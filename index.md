## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile_picture.jpg">

Hello, Welcome to my page :)

About me:
I am currently a doctoral candidate, working on sub-project [AO5](https://trr318.uni-paderborn.de/projekte/a05) - Contextualized and online parametrization of attention in human–robot explanatory dialog. The project is a part of larger interdisciplinary project at Bielefeld and Paderborn University, Transregio TRR318 [„Constructing Explainability“](https://trr318.uni-paderborn.de). 
Under guidance of [Prof. Katharina Rohlfing](https://kw.uni-paderborn.de/institut-fuer-germanistik-und-vergleichende-literaturwissenschaft/germanistische-und-allgemeine-sprachwissenschaft/rohlfing/team/prof-dr-katharina-rohlfing/50352), I am investigating the relationship between linguistic negation and visual attention. More specifically, we are interested to examine whether negation in a process of explanation, could potentially be utilized to guide visual attention in Human-Robot explanatory dialogue. 

My background:
I have completed masters in Cognitive Science from University of Hyderabad and bachelors in Germanistik from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), New Delhi.


## Research Interests

My research interest mainly lies in the domain of psycholinguistics. In order to study the interrelationship between language and attention, currently I make use of eye-tracking methodology.
