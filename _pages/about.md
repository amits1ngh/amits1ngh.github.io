I am a master's degree student in Center for Neural and Cognitive Science, University of Hyderabad. I am working on my master thesis with Prof. Ramesh Kumar Mishra in Action Control and Cognition Lab, University of Hyderabad. The broad aim of my investigation is to understand the cognitive and neural underpinnings of language comprehension at various linguistics levels. I use eye-tracking, psycholinguistic experimentaton and ERP paradigm to study cognitive and neural basis of language comprehension.
