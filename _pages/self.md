I am a master's degree student of Neural and Cognitive Science, University of Hyderabad. My broad areas of investigation are Attention, Vision, Bilingualism and Cognitive Control. Currently, I am working on my master thesis under supervision of [Prof. Ramesh Kumar Mishra](https://rameshkumarmishra.wordpress.com/) in [Action Control and Cognition Lab](https://actioncontrolcognitionlaboratory.wordpress.com/). The aim of my study is to understand the cognitive and neural underpinnings of working memory and selective attention in high proficient Hindi-English bilinguals. I use eye-tracking and psycholinguistic experimentation to study the relationship between attention and language systems at various levels. 


**Research Interests**
- Visual working memory and attention: The dynamic relationship between working memory and attentional system. I ask, whether working memory guides attentional allocation in a top-down manner proactively. I am also trying to investigate the nature of representations in working memory which modulates the goal directed behaviour.

- Language, Vision and Attention: The nature of multimodal correspondence between language, vision and attention. 

- Cognitive Control and Bilingualism : I am investigating whether bilingualism influences executive function.
