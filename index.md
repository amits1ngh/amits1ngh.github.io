I am a doctoral candidate at SFB TRR318 [„Constructing Explainability“](https://trr318.uni-paderborn.de), a collaborative research center at Paderborn and Bielefeld University. As part of [Project-A05](https://trr318.uni-paderborn.de/projekte/a05), I am working under the joint supervision of [Prof. Dr. Katharina Rohlfing](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/person/50352), [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Britta Wrede](https://ekvv.uni-bielefeld.de/pers_publ/publ/PersonDetail.jsp?personId=10380), and [Prof. Dr. Ingrid Scharlau](https://kw.uni-paderborn.de/fach-psychologie/kognitive-psychologie/). Before joining SFB, I completed my M.Sc. in Cognitive Science from University of Hyderabad. 

My broad research interest lies in exploring the online dynamics of multimodal integration (language and vision) in Human-Human and Human-Robot interactional settings. I investigate questions such as how individuals engaged in conversation leverage a myriad of visual and verbal cues to establish shared context, negotiate mutual understanding, and coordinate joint actions. I hope to utilize these findings to incorporate verbal scaffolding strategies in artificial systems that are tailored to users' capabilities, informed by their interaction history, and essentially grounded in cognition.

My methods include eye tracking (mobile and remote), HRI experiments, and statistical modeling.
