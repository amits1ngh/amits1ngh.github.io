I am currently a doctoral candidate in Psycholinguistics at SFB TRR318 [„Constructing Explainability“](https://trr318.uni-paderborn.de), a collaborative research center at Paderborn and Bielefeld University. As part of [Project-A05](https://trr318.uni-paderborn.de/projekte/a05), I am working under the joint supervision of [Prof. Dr. Katharina Rohlfing](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/person/50352), [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Britta Wrede](https://ekvv.uni-bielefeld.de/pers_publ/publ/PersonDetail.jsp?personId=10380), and [Prof. Dr. Ingrid Scharlau](https://kw.uni-paderborn.de/fach-psychologie/kognitive-psychologie/). Before joining SFB, I completed my M.Sc. in Cognitive Science from University of Hyderabad. 

My research focuses on the role of multimodal cues in shaping social interaction, with particular emphasis on how language and vision interact in real-time communication setting.  I investigate cognitive processess underlying social interaction, particularly how individuals engaged in conversations - be it between humans or between human and a robot - leverage a myraid of cues and multimodal signals to establish shared context, negotiate mutual understanding, and coordinate joint actions.

To look into these processes, I have been using online experimental methods (including remote and mobile eye-tracking) and statistical modelling (both Bayesian and frequentist) to analyze data from psycholinguistic experiments.
