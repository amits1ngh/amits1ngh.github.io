I am a master's degree student in Center for Neural and Cognitive Science, University of Hyderabad. Currently, I am working on my master dissertation with Prof. Ramesh Kumar Mishra in Action Control and Cognition Lab. The broad aim of my investigation is to understand the cognitive and neural underpinnings of language comprehension at various linguistics levels. I use eye-tracking, psycholinguistic experimentaton and ERP paradigm to study cognitive and neural basis of language comprehension. 

**Research Interests**
- Cognitive Control and Bilingualism : How the active selection of relevant information from knowledge system and inhibition of irrelevant information competing and cooccurring with the target simultaneously is achieved in bilinguals.

- Working Memory constraint on language processing: How the three distinct phases of working memory encoding, retention and retrieval blocks the irrelevant information from interference by shutting down the task irrelevant regions in the brain.
