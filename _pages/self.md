I am a master's degree student of Neural and Cognitive Science, University of Hyderabad. I completed my bachelors in German Language and Linguistics from Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. My broad areas of investigation are Language and Attention. Currently, I am working on my master thesis under supervision of [Prof. Ramesh Kumar Mishra](https://rameshkumarmishra.wordpress.com/) in [Action Control and Cognition Lab](https://actioncontrolcognitionlaboratory.wordpress.com/). The aim of my study is to understand the cognitive and neural underpinnings of language comprehension at various linguistics levels. I use eye-tracking and psycholinguistic experimentation to study the aforementioned themes. 

**Research Interests**
- Language Vision and Attention: The nature of multimodal correspondence between language, vision and attention. 

- Cognitive Control and Bilingualism : How the active suppression of non-selective task irrelevant information and selection of relevant information is simultaneously achieved in high proficient bilinguals.

- Working Memory and language processing : What is the role of Working Memory in modulating top down control and facilitation of goal relevant information selection.
