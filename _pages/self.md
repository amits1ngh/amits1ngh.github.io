I hold an M.Sc. degree in Neural and Cognitive Science from University of Hyderabad. Before joining Cognitive Science I was a student of B.A.(Hons.) German in JNU, New Delhi. Currently, my broad areas of investigation are Psycholinguistics, Bilingualism and Attention. 
I have completed my master's dissertation under supervision of [Prof. Ramesh Kumar Mishra](https://rameshkumarmishra.wordpress.com/) in [Action Control and Cognition Lab](https://actioncontrolcognitionlaboratory.wordpress.com/). The aim of my study was to investigate the cognitive and neural underpinnings of working memory and selective attention in high proficient Hindi-English bilinguals. I use eye-tracking and psycholinguistic experimentation to study the relationship between attention and language systems at various levels in bilinguals and monolinguals. 

### Research Interests

Some of the questions I am interested to study are: 

* Bilingualism and Cognition : What is the nature of linguistic representations in bilingual mind? Are these representations emergent properties of a single or separate systems? How and when these representations interact cross-linguistically at surface and deep-level in an online and offline task? And how bilingual brain gradually adapts to L2 acquisition?

* Visual working memory and attention: The dynamic relationship between working memory and attentional system. I ask, whether working memory guides attentional allocation in a top-down manner proactively. I am also interested to investigate the nature of representations in working memory which modulates the goal directed behaviour.

* Language, Vision and Attention: The nature of multimodal correspondence between language, vision and attention. 

* Cognitive Control and Bilingualism : I am investigating whether bilingualism influences executive function.
