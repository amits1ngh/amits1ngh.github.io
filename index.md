I am currently a doctoral candidate in Psycholinguistics at SFB TRR318 [„Constructing Explainability“](https://trr318.uni-paderborn.de), a collaborative research center at Paderborn and Bielefeld University. Within the SFB TRR318, I am engaged in [Project-A05](https://trr318.uni-paderborn.de/projekte/a05), a specific research project under the joint supervision of [Prof. Dr. Katharina Rohlfing](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/person/50352), [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Britta Wrede](https://ekvv.uni-bielefeld.de/pers_publ/publ/PersonDetail.jsp?personId=10380), and [Prof. Dr. Ingrid Scharlau](https://kw.uni-paderborn.de/fach-psychologie/kognitive-psychologie/).

Before joining [RTG-TRR318](https://trr318.uni-paderborn.de), I completed my BA (Honours) in Germanistik from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU, India), and M.Sc. in Cognitive Science from University of Hyderabad (UoH, India). Since then I have been investigating the online cognitive processes underlying language and vision, and how they concurrently influence each other. 

Lately, I've been shifting my research focus away from traditional psycholinguistic experiments conducted in isolation and instead placing a stronger emphasis on studying the dynamics of human interaction, particularly within the realm of pragmatics. 

My research delves into the intricacies of social interaction processes, particularly on how individuals engaged in conversations - be it between humans or between human and a robot - leverage a myriad of pragmatic cues to collectively establish a shared context and joint goal within a single communicative framework.

My methodologies include, Eye-tracking (Remote and Mobile) and conversational analysis.

As a side activity and a hobby, I like to do lyrical-bollywood dance and photography.
