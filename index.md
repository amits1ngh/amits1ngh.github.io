## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile_picture.jpg">

I am currently a doctoral candidate at SFB TRR318 [„Constructing Explainability“](https://trr318.uni-paderborn.de), Paderborn University. Under the joint supervision of Prof. Katharina Rohlfing, Prof. Britta Wrede and Prof.Ingrid Scharlau at the Universities of Paderborn and Bielefeld, I am working on [Project-A05](https://trr318.uni-paderborn.de/projekte/a05). Broadly speaking, my research interest lies in the domain of psycholinguistics and cognitive science. In order to study the interrelationship between language and attention, currently I make use of eye-tracking methodology.

As a side activity and a hobby, I like to do lyrical-bollywood dance and photography. Some of those you can find in the navigation section :)
