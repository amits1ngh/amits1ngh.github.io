## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile_picture.jpg">

Hello, Welcome to my page!

About me:
I am currently a doctoral candidate, working on sub-project [AO5](https://trr318.uni-paderborn.de/projekte/a05)-(Contextualized and online parametrization of attention in human–robot explanatory dialog). The project is a part of larger interdisciplinary project at Bielefeld and Paderborn University, Transregio TRR318 [„Constructing Explainability“](https://trr318.uni-paderborn.de). Under guidance of [Prof. Katharina Rohlfing](https://kw.uni-paderborn.de/institut-fuer-germanistik-und-vergleichende-literaturwissenschaft/germanistische-und-allgemeine-sprachwissenschaft/rohlfing/team/prof-dr-katharina-rohlfing/50352), I am investigating the role of linguistic negation on visual attention. More specifically, we are interested to examine whether negation in a process of explaination, could potentially be utilised to model visual attention in Human-Robot explainatory dialogue. 

My background:
I have completed masters in Cognitive Science from [University of Hyderabad](https://uohyd.ac.in) and my bachelor in German Language and Linguistics from School of language, literature and cultural studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi ([JNU](https://www.jnu.ac.in/sllcs/cgs)).

My reserach interest prominently lies in psycholinguistics. I am specifically interested to understand the interplay between langauge and attention. Some of my past and current topic of interests are:-

1. Bilingualism and Cognition: 
Research in bilingualism provides a wide opportunity to study some of key questions in human cognition spanning from language learning, processing and pathology ([draft](assets/Bilingualism_Draft.pdf)). Recent study suggest that bilingual experience induces general cognitive advantage and reserve, which can be administered using flankers and stroop. I attempted to look into the cultural and sociolinguistic factors which is responsible behind this phenomena and how Age of L2 Acquisition and social diversity of langauge use might modulate the cognitive control. 

1. Computational linguistics:
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) provides a robust method to solve multi-class problems efficiently. Leveraging this advantage, I am trying to extract useful feature vectors from multilingual corpus and compare them cross-linguistically to gain insight about the linguistic intrinsic representations and processes at different liguistic levels. I am also interested in information theoretic approach for langauge processing ([draft](assets/Draft_Efficiency&Bilingualism.pdf)).  

2. Cross-linguistic representations:
What is the nature of two or more linguistic representations in bilingual mind? What are the domain general cognitive processes operate on those representations? And how and when these representations interact at surface and deep-level in an online and offline task?  I am also interested to investigate some of these questions using eye-tracking methodology and computational modelling.
